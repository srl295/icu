# Word boundary test data for languages that contain no spaces.
# Boundaries are deliminated with the | character so that it's easier to debug.
#
# If you have test data with zero width spaces to deliminate the words, use the following command example.
# Be sure to copy the zero width space in the sed command.
# echo 'សូម​ចំណាយពេល​បន្តិច​ដើម្បី​អធិស្ឋាន​អរ​ព្រះគុណ​ដល់​ព្រះអង្គ' | sed 's/​/\|/g'
