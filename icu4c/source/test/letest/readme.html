<h2> What are letest and gendata?</h2>
letest is a program you can use to verify that you have built and
installed the ICU LayoutEngine correctly. The test is not
comprehensive, it just verifies that the results of laying out some
Devanagari, Arabic and Thai text are as expected. Once this test has
passed, you can use the ICU LayoutEngine in your application knowing
that it has been correctly installed and that the basic functionality
is in place.
<p>gendata is a program that is used by the ICU team to build the
source file testdata.cpp, which contains the expected results of
running letest. Unless you have changed your copy of the LayoutEngine
and want to validate the changes on other platforms, there's no reason
for you to run this program. </p>
<p>(The ICU team first runs a Windows application which uses the ICU
LayoutEngine to display the text that letest uses. Once it has been
verified that the text is displayed correctly, gendata is run to
produce testdata.cpp, and then letest is run on Windows to verify that
letest still works with the new data.) <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h2> How do I build letest?</h2>
First, you need to build ICU, including the LayoutEngine.
<p>On Windows, the layout project should be listed as a dependency of
all, so layout will build when you build all. If it doesn't for some
reason, just select the layout project in the project toolbar and build
it. </p>
<p>On UNIX systems, you need to add the "--enable-layout=yes" option
when you invoke the runConfigureICU script. When you've done that,
layout should build when you do "make all install" </p>
<p>To build letest on Windows, just open the letest project in
&lt;icu&gt;\source\test\letest and build it. On UNIX systems, connect
to &lt;top-build-dir&gt;/test/letest and do "make all" <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h2> How do I run letest?</h2>
Before you can run letest, you'll need to get the fonts it uses. For
legal reasons, we can't include them with ICU, but you can get them
for free from the web. To do this, you'll need access to a computer
running Windows. Here's how to get the fonts:
<p>Download the 1.3 version of the JDK from the<a
 href="http://www.ibm.com/java"> IBM developerWorks Java technology zone</a>
page. From this page, follow the "Tools and products" link on the left
hand side, and then the link for the "IBM Developer Kit for Linux", or
the "IBM Developer Kit for Windows(R), Release 1.3.0". You'll need to
register with them if you haven't downloaded before. Download and
install the "Runtime Environment Package." You'll need two fonts from
this package. If you've let the installer use it's defaults, the fonts
will be in C:\Program Files\IBM\Java13\jre\lib\fonts. The files you want
are "LucidaSansRegular.ttf" and "Thonburi.ttf" Copy these font files to
the directory from which you'll run letest.<br>
</p>
<p>Next is the Hindi font. Go to the&nbsp; NCST site and download&nbsp;<a
 href="http://rohini.ncst.ernet.in/indix/download/font/raghu.ttf">
raghu.ttf</a>. Be sure to look at the&nbsp;<a
 href="http://rohini.ncst.ernet.in/indix/download/font/README"> README</a>
file before you download the font. You can download raghu.ttf into the
directory from which you'll run letest.<br>
</p>
<p>There's still one more font to get. Go to the Microsoft <a
 href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm">
TrueType core fonts for the Web</a> page and download the "Times New
Roman" font. This will download an installer program, called
"Times32.exe" which will install the Times New Roman fonts in your
fonts folder. (If you've already got these fonts in you fonts folder,
you may want to move them to another folder before you install these
fonts.) </p>
<p>NOTE: this installer will display an End User License Agreement
(EULA) which you must accept before proceeding. Be sure that you read
and understand this agreement before you install the font. </p>
<p>After you run the installer program, it will add the Times Roman
fonts to your fonts folder. Open the fonts folder and copy the "Times
New Roman" font (the file name will be "Times.TTF") to the directory
from which you'll run letest. </p>
<p>That's it! Now all you have to do is run letest (CTRL+F5 in Visual
C++, or "./letest" in UNIX) If&nbsp; everything's OK you should see
something like this: </p>
<blockquote><tt>Test 0, font = raghu.ttf... passed.</tt> <br>
  <tt>Test 1, font = Times.TTF... passed.</tt> <br>
  <tt>Test 2, font = LucidaSansRegular.ttf... passed.</tt> <br>
  <tt>Test 3, font = Thonburi.ttf... passed.</tt></blockquote>
