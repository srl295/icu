<h1>GB 18030</h1>
<p align="right">Markus Scherer, 2000-oct-21</p>

<p>GB 18030 is a new Chinese codepage standard, published 2000-mar-17, that is designed for 
<ul>
    <li>Upwards compatibility with the GB 2312-1980 standard</li>
    <li>Compatibility with the GBK specification, updated for Unicode 3.0</li>
    <li>Full coverage of all Unicode code points similar to a UTF</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Byte sequence structure: 
<ul>
    <li>Single-byte: 00-80</li>
    <li>Two-byte: 81-fe | 40-7e, 80-fe</li>
    <li>Four-byte: 81-fe | 30-39 | 81-fe | 30-39</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Special properties of GB 18030: 
<ul>
    <li>Huge: 1.6 million codepage code points &mdash; probably the largest codepage</li>
    <li>Similar to UTF: All 1.1 million Unicode code points U+0000-U+10ffff map to GB 18030 codes.
        All but 79 Unicode code points can be mapped from GB 18030.
        (I.e., there are 79 Unicode code points with only fallback mappings to GB 18030.)</li>
    <li>Most of these mappings, except for parts of the BMP, can be done algorithmically.
        This makes it an unusual mix of a Unicode encoding with a traditional codepage.</li>
    <li>It is not possible for all codepage byte sequences to determine the length of
        the sequence from the first byte. This is unusual.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Generating a GB 18030 mapping table</h2>

<p>GB 18030 is derived from existing standards and specifications,
and a mapping table can be generated from existing data.
<em>Note: </em>Following this description does not guarantee compatibility with
the standard or any particular implementation.
This section is most useful for understanding the genesis and structure of GB 18030.<br>
### THIS IS ALPHA-VERSION DATA AND DESCRIPTION AND MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE</p>
<ol>
    <li>GBK is a specification (not a standard) that is an extension of GB 2312-1980
        to cover the ideographs in Unicode 2.0. Microsoft co-authored GBK.
        Get a GBK table, e.g. the one for Microsoft Windows 2000 codepage 936
        from <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/charset/">ICU sample charsets</a>.
        (There are <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/charset/CharMaps-UCM/">.ucm files</a>
        including <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/charset/CharMaps-UCM/windows-936-2000.ucm">windows-936-2000.ucm</a>.)</li>
    <li>From the Microsoft codepage table, remove all fallback mappings and the one for GB+ff.
        Note that the Windows 2000 version contains the Euro sign at GB+80=U+20ac.
        Leave it in there for GB 18030.</li>
    <li>Get a copy of appendix E of the GB 18030 standard.
        There are 79 characters with "temporary" and "new" Unicode mappings.
        The temporary ones map to private-use code points because the characters were not assigned in Unicode 2.0.
        In the data, change them from roundtrip mappings to fallbacks.
        The new mappings are to Unicode 3.0 code points.
        Add them as roundtrip mappings to your data.</li>
    <li>U+0080 is not currently mapped by the standard.
        Also, there is a small number of known errors, typos, and ambiguities in the original standard publication.
        See <a href="ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/pub/examples/nutshell/cjkv/pdf/GB18030_Summary.pdf">this summary</a>.
        I have added U+0080=GB+8432eb38 to my data.
        This is not official at this point!</li>
    <li>You should arrive at data like <a href="gbkuni30.txt">gbkuni30.txt</a>.
        This file has the following simplified format on each line:<br>
        <code>unicode (':' | '>') gb ['*']</code><br>
        The left column contains the Unicode code point, the right column the byte sequence in GB 18030.
        The delimiter is either a colon for roundtrip mappings or a greater-than sign
        for fallbacks from Unicode to the codepage.
        I have marked mappings of the appendix E characters with a star.</li>
    <li>Now compile <a href="gbmake4.c">gbmake4</a> and run it with the above file as stdin input.
        You will get as output all the four-byte mappings for all
        BMP code points that do not have a one-byte or two-byte mapping.</li>
    <li>All Unicode code points on the supplementary planes, U+10000-U+10ffff, are mapped as well.
        Their GB 18030 codes are four-byte sequences starting at GB+90308130.
        You can enumerate them lexically by keeping the second and fourth bytes
        between 0x30 and 0x39 and the third byte between 0x81 and 0xfe. For example:</li>
        <pre>
        U+10000=GB+90308130
        U+10001=GB+90308131
        U+10002=GB+90308132
        ...
        U+1000a=GB+90308230
        U+1000b=GB+90308231
        ...
        U+10ffff=GB+e3329a35
        </pre>
        You can calculate linear values and differences between GB 18030 four-byte sequences
        with <a href="lineargb.c">lineargb</a>.
    <li>Done! The result is a set of 0x110000 mappings!</li>
    <li>Of course, an economic implementation would handle the mappings for the
        supplementary planes algorithmically.
        Also, large parts of the BMP mappings are contiguous and can be
        handled similarly. For an ICU MBCS converter, U+fffe and U+ffff should
        in any case be special-cased because these values have special meaning in .cnv files.</li>
    <li>You can have gbmake4 generate a list of contiguous four-byte ranges in the BMP.
        Run it with the same input but specify "r" as an argument.
        Sort the output descending.
        Select the ranges that you deem useful, add the one including U+fffe and U+ffff.
        For example, see <a href="ranges.txt">ranges.txt</a>.</li>
    <li>If you concatenate gbkuni30.txt and your selected ranges including the
        "ranges" line in between, you can run this through gbmake4 again and
        get a mapping table without the code points in the ranges.</li>
    <li>For an ICU converter, turn your data into a .ucm file and
        add the header information.
        Keep the roundtrip/fallback information:
        roundtrip mappings (':') need a trailing "|0", fallback mappings ('>') a trailing "|1".
        You can use <a href="gbtoucm.c">gbtoucm</a>.</li>
    <li>Also for an ICU MBCS converter, you need to specify a state table for the codepage
        that describes its structure. For example, with the supplementary planes and the
        <a href="ranges.txt">suggested ranges</a> handled algorithmically and therefore
        declared as "unassigned", see this <a href="gbstates.txt">sample state table</a>.</li>
    <li>All valid four-byte codepage code points that do not map to
        any Unicode code point are of course unassigned.
        This includes 9012 sequences with a 0x84 lead byte and 9824 with a 0xe3 lead byte,
        as well as about 0.5 million with lead bytes 0x85..0x8f and 0xe4..0xfe.</li>
</ol>
For comparison with other data files, it is possible to reformat a mapping file so that it
contains only mappings from Unicode to GB or only from GB to Unicode.
<a href="gbsingle.c">gbsingle</a> takes input in the simple format of gbkuni30.txt
and outputs even simpler format:<br>
With no command line argument, it writes<br>
    <code>unicode ':' gb</code><br>
including the fallback mappings.
With a "gb" argument, it writes<br>
    <code>gb ':' unicode</code><br>
excluding the fallback mappings according to their definition.
