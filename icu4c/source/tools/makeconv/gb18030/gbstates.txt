# ICU state information for the GB 18030 MBCS codepage
# Note that the entire block for the supplementary Unicode planes is
# marked unassigned because they are handled algorithmically.
# Similarly, some of the BMP mappings are marked as unassigned for the same reason.

# Mostly assigned sequences, with branches in the lead bytes

# Some unassigned 4-byte sequences, one state for each of the lead bytes 81-84
# Each of these states branch on the second of four bytes; for the third and fourth bytes,
# unassigned sequences continue with state 5, assigned ones with state 2
