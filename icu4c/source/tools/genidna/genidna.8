.SH DESCRIPTION
.B genidna
reads filtered RFC 3454 files and compiles their
information into a binary form.
The resulting file,
.BR uidna.icu ,
can then be read directly by ICU, or used by
.BR pkgdata (8)
for incorporation into a larger archive or library.
.LP
The files read by
.B genidna
are described in the
.B FILES
section.
