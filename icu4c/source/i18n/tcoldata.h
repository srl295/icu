// Internal file.  Defines TableCollationData, an internal class which is shared
// by TableCollation objects, and which contains all the invariant (and large)
// pieces of data.  Once created, TableCollationData objects do not change.
//
// Created by: Alan Liu
//
// Modification History:
//
//  Date        Name        Description
//  2/5/97      aliu        Creation.
//  3/5/97      aliu        Don't stream rule table in or out.  Added data members
//                          isRuleTableLoaded, desiredLocale, and realLocaleName,
//                          which are required for dynamic reloading of the rule
//                          string.  We still keep rules in this object so that
//                          they can be held in the in-memory cache.
//  3/26/97     helena      Updated with platform independent data types.
//  6/20/97     helena      Java class name change.
//  8/18/97     helena      Added internal API documentation.

/**
 * TableCollationData is an internal class used by TableCollation.  It
 * encapsulates most of the data associated with a TableCollation.
 * This includes the large collation tables, including the contract
 * order and expand order tables, and some small pieces of data that
 * don't change, such as the maximum secondary order.  The general
 * idea is that the TableCollation object should be a lightweight
 * object.  If there are two TableCollation objects, they will each be
 * very small, and users can alter the strength of each object
 * independently.  However, both objects, if they are refering to the
 * same underlying collation, will share pointers to the same
 * TableCollationData object, which doesn't change.  <P>
 * TableCollationData objects are therefore good candidates for
 * caching in memory and potentially for reference counting.  */
