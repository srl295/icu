/**
 * <code>Transliterator</code> is an abstract class that
 * transliterates text from one format to another.  The most common
 * kind of transliterator is a script, or alphabet, transliterator.
 * For example, a Russian to Latin transliterator changes Russian text
 * written in Cyrillic characters to phonetically equivalent Latin
 * characters.  It does not <em>translate</em> Russian to English!
 * Transliteration, unlike translation, operates on characters, without
 * reference to the meanings of words and sentences.
 *
 * <p>Although script conversion is its most common use, a
 * transliterator can actually perform a more general class of tasks.
 * In fact, <code>Transliterator</code> defines a very general API
 * which specifies only that a segment of the input text is replaced
 * by new text.  The particulars of this conversion are determined
 * entirely by subclasses of <code>Transliterator</code>.
 *
 * <p><b>Transliterators are stateless</b>
 *
 * <p><code>Transliterator</code> objects are <em>stateless</em>; they
 * retain no information between calls to
 * <code>transliterate()</code>.  (However, this does <em>not</em>
 * mean that threads may share transliterators without synchronizing
 * them.  Transliterators are not immutable, so they must be
 * synchronized when shared between threads.)  This1 might seem to
 * limit the complexity of the transliteration operation.  In
 * practice, subclasses perform complex transliterations by delaying
 * the replacement of text until it is known that no other
 * replacements are possible.  In other words, although the
 * <code>Transliterator</code> objects are stateless, the source text
 * itself embodies all the needed information, and delayed operation
 * allows arbitrary complexity.
 *
 * <p><b>Batch transliteration</b>
 *
 * <p>The simplest way to perform transliteration is all at once, on a
 * string of existing text.  This is referred to as <em>batch</em>
 * transliteration.  For example, given a string <code>input</code>
 * and a transliterator <code>t</code>, the call
 *
 * <blockquote><code>String result = t.transliterate(input);
 * </code></blockquote>
 *
 * will transliterate it and return the result.  Other methods allow
 * the client to specify a substring to be transliterated and to use
 * {@link Replaceable} objects instead of strings, in order to
 * preserve out-of-band information (such as text styles).
 *
 * <p><b>Keyboard transliteration</b>
 *
 * <p>Somewhat more involved is <em>keyboard</em>, or incremental
 * transliteration.  This is the transliteration of text that is
 * arriving from some source (typically the user's keyboard) one
 * character at a time, or in some other piecemeal fashion.
 *
 * <p>In keyboard transliteration, a <code>Replaceable</code> buffer
 * stores the text.  As text is inserted, as much as possible is
 * transliterated on the fly.  This means a GUI that displays the
 * contents of the buffer may show text being modified as each new
 * character arrives.
 *
 * <p>Consider the simple <code>RuleBasedTransliterator</code>:
 *
 * <blockquote><code>
 * th&gt;{theta}<br>
 * t&gt;{tau}
 * </code></blockquote>
 *
 * When the user types 't', nothing will happen, since the
 * transliterator is waiting to see if the next character is 'h'.  To
 * remedy this, we introduce the notion of a cursor, marked by a '|'
 * in the output string:
 *
 * <blockquote><code>
 * t&gt;|{tau}<br>
 * {tau}h&gt;{theta}
 * </code></blockquote>
 *
 * Now when the user types 't', tau appears, and if the next character
 * is 'h', the tau changes to a theta.  This is accomplished by
 * maintaining a cursor position (independent of the insertion point,
 * and invisible in the GUI) across calls to
 * <code>transliterate()</code>.  Typically, the cursor will
 * be coincident with the insertion point, but in a case like the one
 * above, it will precede the insertion point.
 *
 * <p>Keyboard transliteration methods maintain a set of three indices
 * that are updated with each call to
 * <code>transliterate()</code>, including the cursor, start,
 * and limit.  Since these indices are changed by the method, they are
 * passed in an <code>int[]</code> array. The <code>START</code> index
 * marks the beginning of the substring that the transliterator will
 * look at.  It is advanced as text becomes committed (but it is not
 * the committed index; that's the <code>CURSOR</code>).  The
 * <code>CURSOR</code> index, described above, marks the point at
 * which the transliterator last stopped, either because it reached
 * the end, or because it required more characters to disambiguate
 * between possible inputs.  The <code>CURSOR</code> can also be
 * explicitly set by rules in a <code>RuleBasedTransliterator</code>.
 * Any characters before the <code>CURSOR</code> index are frozen;
 * future keyboard transliteration calls within this input sequence
 * will not change them.  New text is inserted at the
 * <code>LIMIT</code> index, which marks the end of the substring that
 * the transliterator looks at.
 *
 * <p>Because keyboard transliteration assumes that more characters
 * are to arrive, it is conservative in its operation.  It only
 * transliterates when it can do so unambiguously.  Otherwise it waits
 * for more characters to arrive.  When the client code knows that no
 * more characters are forthcoming, perhaps because the user has
 * performed some input termination operation, then it should call
 * <code>finishTransliteration()</code> to complete any
 * pending transliterations.
 *
 * <p><b>Inverses</b>
 *
 * <p>Pairs of transliterators may be inverses of one another.  For
 * example, if transliterator <b>A</b> transliterates characters by
 * incrementing their Unicode value (so "abc" -> "def"), and
 * transliterator <b>B</b> decrements character values, then <b>A</b>
 * is an inverse of <b>B</b> and vice versa.  If we compose <b>A</b>
 * with <b>B</b> in a compound transliterator, the result is the
 * indentity transliterator, that is, a transliterator that does not
 * change its input text.
 *
 * The <code>Transliterator</code> method <code>getInverse()</code>
 * returns a transliterator's inverse, if one exists, or
 * <code>null</code> otherwise.  However, the result of
 * <code>getInverse()</code> usually will <em>not</em> be a true
 * mathematical inverse.  This is because true inverse transliterators
 * are difficult to formulate.  For example, consider two
 * transliterators: <b>AB</b>, which transliterates the character 'A'
 * to 'B', and <b>BA</b>, which transliterates 'B' to 'A'.  It might
 * seem that these are exact inverses, since
 *
 * <blockquote>"A" x <b>AB</b> -> "B"<br>
 * "B" x <b>BA</b> -> "A"</blockquote>
 *
 * where 'x' represents transliteration.  However,
 *
 * <blockquote>"ABCD" x <b>AB</b> -> "BBCD"<br>
 * "BBCD" x <b>BA</b> -> "AACD"</blockquote>
 *
 * so <b>AB</b> composed with <b>BA</b> is not the
 * identity. Nonetheless, <b>BA</b> may be usefully considered to be
 * <b>AB</b>'s inverse, and it is on this basis that
 * <b>AB</b><code>.getInverse()</code> could legitimately return
 * <b>BA</b>.
 *
 * <p><b>IDs and display names</b>
 *
 * <p>A transliterator is designated by a short identifier string or
 * <em>ID</em>.  IDs follow the format <em>source-destination</em>,
 * where <em>source</em> describes the entity being replaced, and
 * <em>destination</em> describes the entity replacing
 * <em>source</em>.  The entities may be the names of scripts,
 * particular sequences of characters, or whatever else it is that the
 * transliterator converts to or from.  For example, a transliterator
 * from Russian to Latin might be named "Russian-Latin".  A
 * transliterator from keyboard escape sequences to Latin-1 characters
 * might be named "KeyboardEscape-Latin1".  By convention, system
 * entity names are in English, with the initial letters of words
 * capitalized; user entity names may follow any format so long as
 * they do not contain dashes.
 *
 * <p>In addition to programmatic IDs, transliterator objects have
 * display names for presentation in user interfaces, returned by
 * {@link #getDisplayName}.
 *
 * <p><b>Factory methods and registration</b>
 *
 * <p>In general, client code should use the factory method
 * <code>getInstance()</code> to obtain an instance of a
 * transliterator given its ID.  Valid IDs may be enumerated using
 * <code>getAvailableIDs()</code>.  Since transliterators are mutable,
 * multiple calls to <code>getInstance()</code> with the same ID will
 * return distinct objects.
 *
 * <p>In addition to the system transliterators registered at startup,
 * user transliterators may be registered by calling
 * <code>registerInstance()</code> at run time.  A registered instance
 * acts a template; future calls to <tt>getInstance()</tt> with the ID
 * of the registered object return clones of that object.  Thus any
 * object passed to <tt>registerInstance()</tt> must implement
 * <tt>clone()</tt> propertly.  To register a transliterator subclass
 * without instantiating it (until it is needed), users may call
 * <code>registerClass()</code>.  In this case, the objects are
 * instantiated by invoking the zero-argument public constructor of
 * the class.
 *
 * <p><b>Subclassing</b>
 *
 * Subclasses must implement the abstract method
 * <code>handleTransliterate()</code>.  <p>Subclasses should override
 * the <code>transliterate()</code> method taking a
 * <code>Replaceable</code> and the <code>transliterate()</code>
 * method taking a <code>String</code> and <code>StringBuffer</code>
 * if the performance of these methods can be improved over the
 * performance obtained by the default implementations in this class.
