    <p>Today's software market is a global one in which it is desirable to
    develop and maintain one application (single source/single binary) that
    supports a wide variety of languages. The International Components for
    Unicode (C/C++) provides tools to help write platform-independent
    applications that are internationalized and localized, with support
    for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Support for the latest version of the Unicode standard</li>

      <li>Character set conversions, with support for over 200 codepages</li>

      <li>Locale data for more than 220 locales</li>

      <li>Text collation (sorting) based on the Unicode Collation Algorithm
      (=ISO 14651), customizable and tailored for national standards</li>

      <li>Transliteration services for script&lt;-&gt;script transliterations
      and general text operations</li>

      <li>Resource bundles for storing and accessing localized information</li>

      <li>Date/Number/Message formatting and parsing of culture-specific
      input/output formats</li>

      <li>Text boundary analysis for finding characters, word and sentence
      boundaries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>ICU has a sister project <a href=
    "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu4j/">ICU4J</a> that extends the
    internationalization capabilities of Java to a level similar to ICU. The
    ICU C/C++ project is also called ICU4C when a distinction is necessary.</p>

    <h2><a name="News" href="#News">What is new in this release?</a></h2>

    <p>The following list concentrates on changes that affect existing
    applications migrating from previous ICU releases. For more news about this
    release, see the <a href=
    "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/2.1/">ICU 2.1 download
    page</a>.</p>

    <h3>Support for Unicode 3.1.1</h3>

    <p>ICU 2.0 has been upgraded to support <a href=
    "http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/versions/Unicode3.1.1.html">Unicode
    3.1.1</a>, which includes the addition of 44,946 new encoded characters.
    These characters cover several historic scripts, several sets of symbols,
    and a very large collection of additional CJK ideographs.</p>

    <p>As part of this upgrade, a number of ICU services have been reviewed and
    improved with regards to handling supplementary characters (surrogate
    pairs). Especially, normalization is revamped for support of supplementary
    characters and higher performance.</p>

    <p>ICU 2.1 also includes <a href=
    "http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum3.html">Corrigendum #3: U+F951
    Normalization</a>.</p>

    <h3>Memory and resource cleanup</h3>

    <p>ICU is carefully tested for memory leaks. Some memory is held in
    internal caches that do not normally get released during normal operation.
    These are not leaks because ICU continues to use them as necessary.</p>

    <p>For testing purposes (for memory leaks) and for a small number of
    applications it can be useful to close all the memory that is allocated for
    a library. ICU 2.0 supports this with a new function <code><a href=
    "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/apiref/uclean_h.html">u_cleanup()</a></code>
    that may be called after an application has released all ICU objects.
    <code>u_cleanup()</code> will then release all of ICU's internal memory.
    The ICU libraries can then even be unloaded cleanly without shutting down
    the process.</p>

    <h3>Data loading changed</h3>

    <p>ICU data loading is simplified for most users. By default, the ICU build
    creates a DLL/shared library that is linked directly with the common
    library (<code>[lib]icuuc</code>). By placing all ICU libraries including
    the data library into the same folder, ICU should start up and find its
    data immediately. Dynamic loading of data from DLLs/shared libraries is not
    supported any more.</p>

    <p>Before ICU 2.0, ICU did not itself link directly with its data library,
    but some ICU applications did (like the Xerces XML parser) and called
    <code>udata_setCommonData()</code>. This is not necessary any more in the
    default case.<br>
     On the other hand, this same technique can now be used to efficiently load
    application data (e.g., for its own localization). An application can build
    a data DLL/library of its own, link it, and call the new API
    <code>udata_setAppData()</code>.</p>

    <p>For details on finding and loading ICU data and on options for portable,
    common data files etc. see the <a href=
    "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/icudata.html">User's Guide ICU
    Data Chapter</a>.</p>

    <h3>Library linking changed</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Linkage improvement for HP/UX</b> 

        <ul>
          <li>The current directory (.) is now searched for libraries.</li>

          <li>Where available, $ORIGIN is set in the embedded path so that if
          one ICU library is found, the system will be able to locate the
          others.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Library Versioning for AIX (xlC and VisualAge)</b> 

        <ul>
          <li>AIX does not have facilities to enable library versioning. With
          this patch, libraries will now be named for instance
          <tt>libicuuc<b>20.1.so</b></tt> , however symlinks will allow
          applications to still link using <tt>-licuuc</tt> (without the
          benefit of versioning). To benefit from versioning, on AIX link
          against the major and minor versions by using
          <tt>-licuuc20</tt>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Data Library Versioning for all platforms</b> 

        <ul>
          <li>The versioned name for the data library will be linked against by
          the ICU libraries, that is, libicudt20b.so instead of
          libicudata.so</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Multithreaded usage is safer</h3>

    <p>It was discovered that some parts of ICU were not initialized in a
    thread safe manner. This has been fixed.</p>

    <h2><a name="Download" href="#Download">How To Download the Source
    Code</a></h2>

    <p>There are two ways to download ICU releases:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Official Release Snapshot:</strong><br>
       If you want to use ICU (as opposed to developing it), you should
      download an official packaged version of the ICU source code. These
      versions are tested more thoroughly than day-to-day development builds of
      the system, and they are packaged in zip and tar files for convenient
      download. These packaged files can be found at <a href=
      "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/">http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/</a>.<br>

       The packaged snapshots are named <strong>icu-nnnn.zip</strong> or
      <strong>icu-nnnn.tgz</strong>, where nnnn is the version number. The .zip
      file is used for Windows platforms, while the .tgz file is preferred on
      most other platforms.<br>
       Please unzip this file. It will reconstruct the source directory, which
      includes anonymous CVS control directories (see below).</li>

      <li><strong>CVS Source Repository:</strong><br>
       If you are interested in developing features, patches, or bug fixes for
      ICU, you should probably be working with the latest version of the ICU
      source code. You will need to check the code out of our CVS repository to
      ensure that you have the most recent version of all of the files. See our
      <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/develop/cvs.html">CVS page</a>
      for details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="SourceCode" href="#SourceCode">ICU Source Code
    Organization</a></h2>

    <p>In the descriptions below, <strong><i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i></strong> is the
    full path name of the icu directory (the top level directory from the
    distribution archives) in your file system. You can also view the <a href=
    "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/design.html">User's Guide</a> to
    see which libraries you need for your software product. You need at least
    the data (<code>[lib]icudt</code>) and the common (<code>[lib]icuuc</code>)
    libraries in order to use ICU.</p>

    <h3><a name="HowToBuildWindows" href="#HowToBuildWindows">How To Build And
    Install On Windows</a></h3>

    <p>Building International Components for Unicode requires:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft NT 4.0 and above, or Windows 98 and above</li>

      <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (Service Pack 2 is required to work with the
      release build of max speed optimization).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>(If you want to build with Microsoft Visual C++ .NET, please refer to
    the <a href="#HowToBuildWindowsDotNet">note about building with Visual
    Studio .NET</a> below.)</p>

    <p>The steps are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Unzip the icu-XXXX.zip file into any convenient location. Using
      command line zip, type "unzip -a icu-XXXX.zip -d drive:\directory", or
      just use WinZip.</li>

      <li>Be sure that the ICU binary directory, <i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\bin\, is
      included in the <strong>PATH</strong> environment variable. The tests
      will not work without the location of the ICU dll files in the path.</li>

      <li>Set the <strong>TZ</strong> environment variable to
      <strong>PST8PDT</strong>. The tests will not work in any other time
      zone.</li>

      <li>Open the "<i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\source\allinone\allinone.dsw" workspace
      file in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. (This workspace includes all the
      International Components for Unicode libraries, necessary ICU building
      tools, and the intltest and cintltest test suite projects). Please see
      the note below if you want to build from the command line instead.</li>

      <li>Set the active Project to the "all" project. To do this: Choose
      "Project" menu, and select "Set active project". In the submenu, select
      the "all" workspace.</li>

      <li>Set the active configuration to "Win32 Debug" or "Win32 Release" (See
      <a href="#HowToBuildWindowsConfig">note</a> below).</li>

      <li>Choose the "Build" menu and select "Rebuild All". If you want to
      build the Debug and Release at the same time, see the <a href=
      "#HowToBuildWindowsBatch">note</a> below.</li>

      <li>Run the C++ test suite, "intltest". To do this: set the active
      project to "intltest", and press F5 to run it.</li>

      <li>Run the C test suite, "cintltst". To do this: set the active project
      to "cintltst", and press F5 to run it.</li>

      <li>Make sure that both "cintltst" and "intltest" passed without any
      errors. The return codes are non-zero when they do not pass. Visual C++
      will display the return codes in the debug tag of the output window. When
      "intltest" and "cintltest" return 0, it means that everything is
      installed correctly. You can press Ctrl+F5 on the test project to run the
      test and see what error messages were displayed (if any tests
      failed).</li>

      <li>Reset the <strong>TZ</strong> environment variable to its original
      value, unless you plan on testing ICU any further.</li>

      <li>You are now able to develop applications with ICU by using the
      libraries and tools in <i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\bin\. The headers are in
      <i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\include\ and the link libraries are in
      <i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\lib\. To install the ICU runtime on a machine, or ship
      it with your application, copy the needed components from
      <i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\bin\ to a location on the system PATH or to your
      application directory.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><a name="HowToBuildWindowsCommandLine"><strong>Using MSDEV At The
    Command Line Note:</strong></a> You can build ICU from the command line.
    Assuming that you have properly installed Microsoft Visual C++ to support
    command line execution, you can run the following command, 'msdev
    <i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\source\allinone\allinone.dsw /MAKE "ALL"'.</p>

    <p><a name="HowToBuildWindowsConfig"><strong>Setting Active Configuration
    Note:</strong></a> To set the active configuration, two different
    possibilities are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Choose "Build" menu, select "Set Active Configuration", and select
      "Win32 Release" or "Win32 Debug".</li>

      <li>Another way is to select "Customize" in the "Tools" menu, select the
      "Toolbars" tab, enable "Build" instead of "Build Minibar", and click on
      "Close". This will bring up a toolbar which you can move aside the other
      permanent toolbars at the top of the MSVC window. The advantage is that
      you now have an easy-to-reach pop-up menu that will always show the
      currently selected active configuration. Or, you can drag the project and
      configuration selections and drop them on the menu bar for later
      selection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a name="HowToBuildWindowsBatch"><strong>Batch Configuration
    Note:</strong></a> If you want to build the Debug and Release
    configurations at the same time, choose "Build" menu and select "Batch
    Build..." instead (and mark all configurations as checked), then click the
    button named "Rebuild All". The "all" workspace will build all the
    libraries, test programs and various ICU tools (e.g. genrb for generating
    binary locale data files).</p>

    <p><a name="HowToBuildWindowsDotNet"><strong>Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
    Note:</strong></a> ICU will build with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET, though
    this is not a supported platform at the time of this writing. Visual Studio
    .NET will offer to convert the project files when you open the existing
    workspace file. Choose "Yes to All" in the dialog asking whether to convert
    the files or not (this creates new files) and then follow the rest of the
    build instructions.</p>

    <h3><a name="HowToBuildUnix" href="#HowToBuildUnix">How To Build And
    Install On Unix</a></h3>

    <p>Building International Components for Unicode on Unix requires:</p>

    <p>A UNIX C++ compiler, (gcc, CC, xlC_r, etc...) installed on the target
    machine. A recent version of GNU make (3.7+). For a list of OS/390 tools
    please view the <a href="#HowToBuildOS390">OS/390 build section</a> of this
    document for further details.</p>

    <p>The steps are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Decompress the icuXXXX.tar (or icuXXXX.tgz) file. For example,
      <tt>gunzip -d &lt; icuXXXX.tgz | tar xvf -</tt></li>

      <li>Change directory to the "icu/source".</li>

      <li>Run "chmod +x runConfigureICU configure install-sh" as these files
      may have the wrong permissions.</li>

      <li>Run the <a href="source/runConfigureICU">runConfigureICU</a> script
      for your platform. (See <a href="#HowToConfigureICU">note</a>
      below).</li>

      <li>Type "gmake" (or "make" if GNU make is the default make on your
      platform) to compile the libraries and all the data files. The proper
      name of the GNU make command is printed at the end of the configuration
      run, as in "You must use gmake to compile ICU".</li>

      <li>Optionally, type "gmake check" (or "make check") to run the test
      suite, which checks for ICU's functionality integrity (See <a href=
      "#HowToTestWithoutGmake">note</a> below).</li>

      <li>Type "gmake install" (or "make install") to install. The install
      targets support the use of the DESTDIR variable to create the
      installation tree under a specific destination directory. (See <a href=
      "#HowToInstallICU">note</a> below).</li>
    </ol>

    <p><a name="HowToConfigureICU"><strong>Configuring ICU NOTE:</strong></a>
    Type "./runConfigureICU --help" for help on how to run it and a list of
    supported platforms. You may also want to type "./configure --help" to
    print the available configure options that you may want to give
    runConfigureICU. If you are not using the runConfigureICU script, or your
    platform is not supported by the script, you may need to set your CC,CXX,
    CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables, and type "./configure". Some of
    the more frequently used options to configure are --disable-64bit-libs to
    create 32-bit libraries, and --srcdir to do out of source builds (build the
    libraries in the current location).</p>

    <p><a name="HowToTestWithoutGmake"><strong>Running The Tests From The
    Command Line NOTE:</strong></a> You may have to set certain variables if
    you with to run test programs individually, that is apart from "make
    check". The <strong>TZ</strong> environment variable needs to be set to
    <strong>PST8PDT</strong>. Also, the environment variable
    <strong>ICU_DATA</strong> can be set to the full pathname of the data
    directory to indicate where the locale data files and conversion mapping
    tables are. The trailing "/" is required after the directory name (e.g.
    "$Root/source/data/" will work, but the value "$Root/source/data" is not
    acceptable). You do not need to set <strong>ICU_DATA</strong> if the
    complete data library is in your library path.</p>

    <p><a name="HowToInstallICU"><strong>Installing ICU NOTE:</strong></a> If
    you are using the "gmake install" command, using the "--prefix" option on
    configure or runConfigureICU will install ICU to the specified
    location.</p>

    <p>Some platforms use package management tools to control the installation
    and uninstallation of files on the system, as well as the integrity of the
    system configuration. You may want to check if ICU can be packaged for your
    package management tools by looking into the "packaging" directory. (Please
    note that if you are using a snapshot of ICU from CVS, it is probable that
    the packaging scripts or related files are not up to date with the contents
    of ICU at this time, so use them with caution).</p>

    <h3><a name="HowToBuildOS390" href="#HowToBuildOS390">OS/390 (zSeries)
    Platform</a></h3>

    <p>If you are building on the OS/390 UNIX System Services platform, it is
    important that you understand a few details:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The gnu utilities gmake and gzip/gunzip are needed and can be
      obtained for OS/390 from <a href=
      "http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/unix/bpxa1ty1.html#opensrc">
      z/OS Unix - Tools and Toys</a>. Documentation on these tools can be found
      at the <a href=
      "http://publib-b.boulder.ibm.com/Redbooks.nsf/RedbookAbstracts/sg245944.html">
      Open Source Software for OS/390 UNIX</a> Red Book.</li>

      <li>Encoding considerations: The source code assumes that it is compiled
      with codepage ibm-1047 (to be exact, the UNIX System Services variant of
      it). The pax command converts all of the source code files from ASCII to
      codepage ibm-1047 (USS) EBCDIC. However, some files are binary files and
      must not be converted, or must be converted back to their original state.
      You can use the <a href="as_is/os390/unpax-icu.sh">unpax-icu.sh</a>
      script to do this for you automatically. It will unpackage the tar file
      and convert all the necessary files for you automatically.</li>

      <li>
        <p>OS/390 supports both native S/390 hexadecimal floating point and,
        (with Version 2.6 and later) IEEE binary floating point. This is a
        compile time option. Applications built with IEEE should use ICU dlls
        that are built with IEEE (and vice versa). The environment variable
        IEEE390=1 will cause the OS/390 version of ICU to be built with IEEE
        floating point. The default is native hexadecimal floating point.<br>
         <em>Important:</em> Currently (ICU 1.4.2), native floating point
        support is sufficient for codepage conversion, resource bundle and
        UnicodeString operations, but the Format APIs, especially ChoiceFormat,
        require IEEE binary floating point.</p>

        <p>Examples for configuring ICU:<br>
         Debug build: <code>IEEE390=1 ./runConfigureICU --enable-debug
        zOS/cxx</code><br>
         Release build: <code>IEEE390=1 ./runConfigureICU zOS/cxx</code></p>
      </li>

      <li>Since the default make on OS/390 is not gmake, the pkgdata tool
      requires that the "make" command is aliased to your installed version of
      gmake.</li>

      <li>The makedep executable that is used with the OS/390 ICU build process
      is not shipped with ICU. It is available at the <a href=
      "http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/unix/bpxa1ty1.html#opensrc">
      z/OS Unix - Tools and Toys</a> site. The PATH environment variable should
      be updated to contain the location of this executable prior to build.
      Alternatively, makedep may be moved into an existing PATH directory.</li>

      <li>
        To run all of the tests for ICU, use "gmake check". When running
        individual tests of the test suite, the TZ environment variable should
        be set to export TZ="PST8PDT" so that time zone comparisons are
        correct. Building and testing ICU without using gmake requires that the
        ICU libraries in the LIBPATH. In other words, the LIBPATH should
        contain (each path prepended with the root directory that contains the
        icu directory): 

        <ul>
          <li>icu/source/common</li>

          <li>icu/source/data</li>

          <li>icu/source/i18n</li>

          <li>icu/source/tools/ctestfw</li>

          <li>icu/source/tools/toolutil</li>

          <li>icu/source/extra/ustdio</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>OS/390 Batch (PDS) support</h4>

    <p>By default, ICU builds its libraries into the HFS. However, there is a
    390-specific switch to build some libraries into PDS files. The switch is
    the environmental variable OS390BATCH, and if set, the following libraries
    are built into PDS files: libicuuc<i>XX</i>.dll, libicudt<i>XX</i>e.dll,
    libicudt<i>XX</i>e_390.dll, and libtestdata.dll. Turning on OS390BATCH does
    not turn off the normal HFS build, thus the HFS dlls will always be
    created.</p>

    <p>The names of the PDS files are determined by the value of the
    environmental variables LOADMOD and LOADEXP. These variables must contain
    the target PDS names whenever the OS390BATCH variable is set. LOADMOD is
    the library (.dll) target dataset and LOADEXP is the side deck (.x) target
    dataset.</p>

    <p>The PDS member names are as follows:</p>
<pre>
<samp>IXMI<i>XX</i>UC --&gt; libicuuc<i>XX</i>.dll
IXMI<i>XX</i>DA --&gt; libicudt<i>XX</i>e.dll

    <h2><a name="ImportantNotes" href="#ImportantNotes">Important Notes About
    Using ICU</a></h2>

    <h3><a name="ImportantNotesCPlusPlus" href="#ImportantNotesCPlusPlus">Using
    ICU in a Multithreaded Environment</a></h3>

    <p>If you are using ICU in a multithreaded application, there may be a
    chance that the ICU global mutex is not initialized properly. Normally the
    ICU global mutex is initialized during C++ static initialization, but there
    are some compilers and linkers that do not properly perform C++ static
    initialization in a library (this sometimes happens on HP/UX and on MacOS
    X).</p>

    <p>Upon the first usage of most ICU APIs, the global mutex will get
    initialized. For example, you could call uloc_countAvailable() or
    uloc_getDefault() from your main() function before any threads are created.
    Those functions will initialize the global mutex. Without one of these
    function calls from a single thread, the data caches inside ICU may get
    initialized more than once, which may cause memory leaks and other
    problems. This problem normally does not happen when C++ static
    initialization works properly.</p>

    <p>ICU does not use C++ static initialization for anything else, and
    disabling threads in ICU will disable all C++ static initialization in
    ICU.</p>

    <h3><a name="ImportantNotesWindows" href="#ImportantNotesWindows">Windows
    Platform</a></h3>

    <p>If you are building on the Win32 platform, it is important that you
    understand a few of the following build details.</p>

    <h4>DLL directories and the PATH setting</h4>

    <p>As delivered, the International Components for Unicode build as several
    DLLs, which are placed in the "<i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\bin" directory. You must
    add this directory to the PATH environment variable in your system, or any
    executables you build will not be able to access International Components
    for Unicode libraries. Alternatively, you can copy the DLL files into a
    directory already in your PATH, but we do not recommend this. You can wind
    up with multiple copies of the DLL and wind up using the wrong one.</p>

    <h4><a name="ImportantNotesWindowsPath">Changing your PATH</a></h4>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Windows 2000</strong>: Use the System Icon in the Control
      Panel. Pick the "Advanced" tab. Select the "Environment Variables..."
      button. Select the variable PATH in the lower box, and select the lower
      "Edit..." button. In the "Variable Value" box, append the string
      ";<i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\bin" to the end of the path string. If there is
      nothing there, just type in "<i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\bin". Click the Set
      button, then the OK button.</li>

      <li><strong>Windows NT</strong>: Use the System Icon in the Control
      Panel. Pick the "Environment" tab, and select the variable PATH in the
      lower box. In the "value" box, append the string
      ";<i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\bin" at the end of the path string. If there is
      nothing there, just type in "<i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\bin". Click the Set
      button, then the OK button.</li>

      <li><strong>Windows 95/98/ME</strong>: Edit the autoexec.bat, and add the
      following line to the end of file, "SET
      PATH=%PATH%;<i>&lt;ICU&gt;</i>\bin"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: When packaging a Windows application for distribution and
    installation on user systems, copies of the ICU DLLs should be included
    with the application, and installed for exclusive use by the application.
    This is the only way to insure that your app is running with the same
    version of ICU, built with exactly the same options, that you developed and
    tested with. Refer to Microsoft's guidelines on the usage of DLLs, or
    search for the phrase "DLL hell" on <a href=
    "http://msdn.microsoft.com/">msdn.microsoft.com</a>.</p>

    <h4>Linking with Runtime libraries</h4>

    <p>All the DLLs link with the C runtime library "Debug Multithreaded DLL"
    or "Multithreaded DLL." (This is changed through the Project Settings
    dialog, on the C/C++ tab, under Code Generation.) It is important that any
    executable or other DLL you build which uses the International Components
    for Unicode DLLs links with these runtime libraries as well. If you do not
    do this, you will get random memory errors when you run the executable.<br>
    </p>

    <h3><a name="ImportantNotesUnix" href="#ImportantNotesUnix">Unix Type
    Platform</a></h3>

    <p>If you are building on a Unix platform, and if you are installing ICU in
    a non-standard location, you may need to add the location of your ICU
    libraries to your <strong>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong> environment variable (or
    the equivalent runtime library path environment variable for your system).
    The ICU libraries may not link or load properly without doing this.</p>

    <p>Note that if you do not want to have to set this variable, you may
    instead use the --enable-rpath option at configuration time. This option
    will instruct the linker to always look for the libraries where they are
    installed. You will need to use the appropriate linker options when linking
    your own applications and libraries against ICU, too. Please refer to your
    system's linker manual for information about runtime paths. The use of
    rpath also means that when building a new version of ICU you should not
    have an older version installed in the same place as the new version's
    installation directory, as the older libraries will used during the build,
    instead of the new ones, likely leading to an incorrectly build ICU. (This
    is the proper behavior of rpath.)</p>

    <h3><a name="ImportantNotesDefaultCP" href="#ImportantNotesDefaultCP">Using
    the default codepage</a></h3>

    <p>ICU has code to determine the default codepage of the system or process.
    This default codepage can be used to convert <code>char *</code> strings to
    and from Unicode.</p>

    <p>Depending on system design, setup and APIs, it may not always be
    possible to find a default codepage that fully works as expected. For
    example,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>On Windows there are three encodings in use at the same time. Unicode
      (UTF-16) is always used inside of Windows, while for <code>char *</code>
      encodings there are two classes, called "ANSI" and "OEM" codepages. ICU
      will use the ANSI codepage. Note that the OEM codepage is used by default
      for console window output.</li>

      <li>On some Unix-type systems, non-standard names are used for encodings,
      or non-standard encodings are used altogether. Although ICU supports 200
      encodings in its standard build and many more aliases for them, it will
      not be able to recognize such non-standard names.</li>

      <li>Some systems do not have a notion of a system or process codepage,
      and may not have APIs for that.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have means of detecting a default codepage name that are more
    appropriate for your application, then you should set that name with
    <code>ucnv_setDefaultName()</code> as the first ICU function call. This
    makes sure that the internally cached default converter will be
    instantiated from your preferred name.</p>

    <p>Starting in ICU 2.0, when a converter for the default codepage cannot be
    opened, a fallback default codepage name and converter will be used. On
    most platforms, this will be US-ASCII. For OS/390 (z/OS), ibm-1047-s390 is
    the default fallback codepage. For AS/400 (iSeries), ibm-37 is the default
    fallback codepage. This default fallback codepage is used when the
    operating system is using a non-standard name for a default codepage, or
    the converter was not packaged with ICU. The feature allows ICU to run in
    unusual computing environments without completely failing.</p>

    <h3><a name="ImportantNotesDeprecatedAPI" href=
    "#ImportantNotesDeprecatedAPI">Methods for enabling deprecated
    APIs</a></h3>

    <h4>C</h4>

    <p>Some deprecated C APIs can be enabled without recompiling the ICU
    libraries. This can be achieved by defining certain symbols before
    including the ICU header files. For example, to enable deprecated C APIs
    for formatting.</p>
<pre>
<samp>#ifndef U_USE_DEPRECATED_FORMAT_API
#  define U_USE_DEPRECATED_FORMAT_API 1
#endif

#include "unicode/udat.h"

int main(){
    UDateFormat *def, *fr, *fr_pat ;
    UErrorCode status = U_ZERO_ERROR;
    UChar temp[30];

    fr = udat_open(UDAT_FULL, UDAT_DEFAULT, "fr_FR", NULL,0, &amp;status);
    if(U_FAILURE(status)){
        printf("Error creating the french dateformat using full time style\n %s\n",
            myErrorName(status) );
    }
    /* This is supposed to open default date format,
       but later on it treats it like it is "en_US".
       This is very bad when you try to run the tests
       on a machine where the default locale is NOT "en_US"
    */
    def = udat_open(UDAT_SHORT, UDAT_SHORT, "en_US", NULL, 0, &amp;status);
    if(U_FAILURE(status)){
        .... /* handle the error */
    }
}</samp>
</pre>

    <h4>C++</h4>

    <p>Deprecated C++ APIs cannot be enabled without recompiling ICU libraries.
    Every service has a specific symbol that should be defined to enable the
    deprecated API of that service. For example: To enable deprecated APIs in
    transliteration service, the U_USE_DEPRECATED_TRANSLITERATOR_API symbol
    should be defined before compiling ICU.</p>

    <h2><a name="PlatformDependencies" href="#PlatformDependencies">Platform
    Dependencies</a></h2>

    <p>The platform dependencies have been mostly isolated into the following
    files in the common library. This information can be useful if you are
    porting ICU to a new platform.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>unicode/platform.h.in</strong> (autoconf'ed platforms)<br>
         <strong>unicode/p<i>XXXX</i>.h</strong> (others: pwin32.h, pmacos.h,
        ..): Platform-dependent typedefs and defines:<br>
        <br>
         

        <ul>
          <li>XP_CPLUSPLUS for C++ only.</li>

          <li>TRUE and FALSE, UBool, int8_t, int16_t etc.</li>

          <li>U_EXPORT and U_IMPORT for specifying dynamic library import and
          export</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>unicode/putil.h, putil.c</strong>: platform-dependent
        implementations of various functions that are platform dependent:<br>
        <br>
         

        <ul>
          <li>uprv_isNaN, uprv_isInfinite, uprv_getNaN and uprv_getInfinity for
          handling special floating point values.</li>

          <li>uprv_tzset, uprv_timezone, uprv_tzname and time for getting
          platform specific time and time zone information.</li>

          <li>u_getDataDirectory for getting the default data directory.</li>

          <li>uprv_getDefaultLocaleID for getting the default locale
          setting.</li>

          <li>uprv_getDefaultCodepage for getting the default codepage
          encoding.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>umutex.h, umutex.c</strong>: Code for doing synchronization in
        multithreaded applications. If you wish to use International Components
        for Unicode in a multithreaded application, you must provide a
        synchronization primitive that the classes can use to protect their
        global data against simultaneous modifications. See Users' guide for
        more information.<br>
        <br>
         

        <ul>
          <li>We supply sample implementations for WinNT, Win95, Win98,
          Sun/Solaris, RedHat/Linux, HP-UX and for AIX on an RS/6000.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </li>

      <li><strong>umapfile.h, umapfile.c</strong>: functions for mapping or
      otherwise reading or loading files into memory. All access by ICU to data
      from files makes use of these functions.<br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>For the intltest test suite, intltest.cpp in
      "icu/source/test/intltest/" contains the method pathnameInContext, which
      must also be adapted to any new platform.</li>

      <li>Using platform specific #ifdef macros are highly discouraged outside
      of the scope of these files. When the source code gets updated in the
      future, these #ifdef's can cause testing problems for your platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is possible to build each library individually. They must be built in
    the following order:<br>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>stubdata</li>

      <li>common</li>

      <li>i18n</li>
