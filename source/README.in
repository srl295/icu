The ICU data files moved!

ICU data, which are architecture and/or platform dependent, were moved to

	@thelibdir@/@PACKAGE@/@VERSION@

This move happened post ICU 1.6. The rationale for the move is to be able
to share @thedatadir@ across machines with different architectures, as
it is supposed to be the case.
