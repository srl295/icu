Friday, Aug 13, 1999              ICU XMLConverter Sample
-------------------- 

  XMLConverter is an example which demonstrates codepage converersion
between XML files.  (For more information on XML, see the IBM XML4C
project which is available at:
                         http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/tech/xml4c
  The XML4C++ uses ICU internally for conversion.)


  XML Files contain their encoding at the top, as in the following
example:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ascii" ?>

  To use the XMLConverter, try the following example:

   XMLConverter -v -e utf-16be samples/animal.xml samples/animal_utf16.xml

  This will create a file named animal_utf16.xml which is in the utf16
big-endian codepage.

Currently the following encodings are supported:

 ascii, utf8, utf-16be, utf-16le, ebcdic-cp-us
