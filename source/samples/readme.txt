* Where can I find more sample code?

 - The "uconv" utility is a full-featured command line application.
    It is normally built with ICU, and is located in icu/source/extra/uconv

 - The "icuapps" CVS module contains other applications and libraries not
    included with ICU.  You can check it out from the CVS command line
    by using for example,  "cvs co icuapps" instead of "cvs co icu",
   or through WebCVS at http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/icuapps/
