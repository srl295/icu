# ICU state information for the GB 18030 MBCS codepage
# Note that the entire block for the supplementary Unicode planes is
# marked unassigned because they are handled algorithmically.
# Similarly, some of the BMP mappings are marked as unassigned for the same reason.

# Mostly assigned sequences, with branches in the lead bytes
