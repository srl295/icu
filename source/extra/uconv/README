uconv
=====

uconv demonstration example of ICU and codepage conversion.
The purpose is to be a replacement tool for the UNIX iconv program, and
to show how to use the class UnicodeConverterCPP.

Compiling
=========

See the README in the parent (icuapps) directory.

Running
=======

uconv converts files from one encoding to another. Just type uconv and it
will tell you the usage. It works similar to the iconv found in UNIX98 
compliant systems.

TESTING uconv
=============

In the utf8 and charset  directories you can find some texts, which you can use to test uconv
with. In the charset directory you can find texts encoded in different codepages. 
Not all the codepages are supported by uconv yet, i.e. no euc* are supported.

Note on running the example in Linux/UNIX (1999)
================================================

The i18n support  in Linux isn't as good as it should be, so to display other
than ISO-8859-x on your console means problems. But there is much work in
progress to eliminate this. In the meantime, please have a look at the 
"UTF8 and Unicode FAQ for UNIX/Linux":  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html

To be able to display Unicode characters from far-away languages 
you need a suitable font. The easiest is to use Roman Czyborra's free unicode
font. The font is not beautiful, but useful for testing purposes. Have a look at: 
"Proposal for GNU Unicode font" http://czyborra.com/unifont/. This is
not a TrueType font so it won't work in Windows and on Macs.


Note on TMAKE (and those strange *.pro files)
=============================================

Maybe you noticed the *.pro file. This is a source-file for the
Makefile-generator tmake, which was written by Troll Tech. 
It works in both UNIX and Windows, but you need to have Perl 
installed. More information can be found on 
http://www.troll.no/freebies/tmake.html.
Usage: tmake uconv.pro > Makefile

Hope this will get you going with the ICU library
