WARNING!!

These directories contain some Unicode tools used to build various files,
and to check the consistency of the Unicode releases.

They are NOT production level code, and should never be used in programs.
The API is subject to change without notice, and will not be maintained.
The source is uncommented, and not well structured -- classic spaghetti style.

There is no build mechanism. Visual Cafe files are included, but
may not be up-to-date.
