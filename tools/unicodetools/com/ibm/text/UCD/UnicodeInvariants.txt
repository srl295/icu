# Invariance tests
# Each line indicates an invariant set relationship to be tested,
# and is of the form:
#
# 	line := set relation set
#
#   relation := '='             // has identical contents to
#            := ('>' | '⊃')    // is proper superset of
#            := ('≥' | '⊇')    // is superset of 
#            := ('<' | '⊂')    // is proper subset of
#            := ('≤' | '⊆')    // is subset of
#            := '!'             // has no intersection
#            := '?'             // none of the above (they overlap, and neither contains the other)
#
# A set is a standard UnicodeSet, but where $pv can be used to express properties
#
# 	pv := '$' '×'? prop (('=' | ':') value)?
#
# The × indicates that the property is the previous released version.
#  That is, if the version is 4.0.1, then the × version is 4.0.0
# If the value is missing, it is defaulted to true
# If the value is of the form «...», then the ... is interpreted as a regular expression
# The property can be the short or long form as in the PropertyAliases.txt
# The value (if enumerated) can be the short or long form as in PropertyValueAliases.txt
#
# A UnicodeSet is a boolean combinations of properties and character ranges, as you would see in
#  Perl or other regular-expression languages. Examples:
#	[$General_Category:Unassigned-[a-zA-Z]]
# For details, see http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/unicodeSet.html
#
# WARNING: do not use \p{...} or [:...:] syntax, since those will be
# ICU's current version of properties, not the current snapshot's.
# Use the $ notation for properties (listed above) instead.
#
# When this file is parsed, an error message may contain <@>
#  to indicate the location of an error in the input line.
