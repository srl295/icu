# Unicode Character Database: Derived Property Data
# This file shows when various code points were designated in Unicode
# Notes:
# - The term 'designated' means that a previously reserved code point was specified
#   to be a noncharacter or surrogate, or assigned as a character,
#   control or format code.
# - Versions are only tracked from 1.1 onwards, since version 1.0
#   predated changes required by the ISO 10646 merger.
# - The Hangul Syllables that were removed from 2.0 are not included in the 1.1 listing.
# - The supplementary private use code points and the non-character code points
#   were designated in version 2.0, but not specifically listed in the UCD
#   until versions 3.0 and 3.1 respectively.
#
# For details on the contents of each version, see
