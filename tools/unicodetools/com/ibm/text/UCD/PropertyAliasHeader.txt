# PropertyAliases-3.2.0.txt
#
# This file contains aliases for properties and property values used in the UCD.
# These names can be used for XML formats of UCD data, for regular-expression
# property tests, and other programmatic textual descriptions of Unicode data.
# The names are not normative, except where they correspond to normative values
# in the UCD.
#
# The names may be translated in appropriate environments, and additional
# aliases may be useful.
#
# FORMAT
#
# Each line has three fields. Where the first field is AA, BB, or ZZ, then
# the line describes a property name.
# AA - non-enumerated properties
# BB - enumerated, non-binary properties
# ZZ - binary properties and quick-check properties
#
# (The values AA, BB, and ZZ are arbitrary -- they were simply chosen to distinguish
# the different types.)
#
# Where the first field is not one of the above, the line describes a
# property value name. The first field describes the property for which that
# property value name is used. There are two special properties:
#
# xx stands for any binary property
# qc stands for any quick-check property
#
# With loose matching of property names, case distinctions, whitespace,
# and '_' are ignored.
#
# NOTE: the property value names are NOT unique across properties, especially
# with loose matches. For example,
# AL means Arabic Letter for the Bidi_Class property, and
# AL means Alpha_Left for the Combining_Class property, and
# AL means Alphabetic for the Line_Break property.
#
# In addition, some property names may be the same as some property value names:
# cc means Combining_Class property, and
# cc means the General_Category property value Control (cc)
#
# The combination of property value and property name is, however, unique.
# For more information, see UTR #24: Regular Expression Guidelines
