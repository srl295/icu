# This file contains aliases for properties used in the UCD.
# These names can be used for XML formats of UCD data, for regular-expression
# property tests, and other programmatic textual descriptions of Unicode data.
# For information on which properties are normative, see UCD.html.
#
# The names may be translated in appropriate environments, and additional
# aliases may be useful.
#
# FORMAT
#
# Each line has two fields, separated by semicolons.
#
# First Field: The first field is an abbreviated name for the property.
#
# Second Field: The second field is a long name
#
# With loose matching of property names, the case distinctions, whitespace,
# and '_' are ignored.
#
# NOTE: Currently there is at most one abbreviated name and one long name for
# each property. However, in the future additional aliases may be added.
#
# NOTE: The property value names are NOT unique across properties, especially
# with loose matches. For example:
#
#   AL means Arabic Letter for the Bidi_Class property, and
#   AL means Alpha_Left for the Combining_Class property, and
#   AL means Alphabetic for the Line_Break property.
#
# In addition, some property names may be the same as some property value names.
#
# The combination of property value and property name is, however, unique.
# For more information, see UTR #18: Regular Expression Guidelines
