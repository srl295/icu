# Special Casing Properties
#
# This file is a supplement to the UnicodeData file.
# It contains additional information about the casing of Unicode characters.
# (For compatibility, the UnicodeData.txt file only contains case mappings for
# characters where they are 1-1, and does not have locale-specific mappings.)
# For more information, see the discussion of Case Mappings in the Unicode Standard.

# Format
# ================================================================================
# The entries in this file are in the following machine-readable format:
#
# <code>; <lower> ; <title> ; <upper> ; (<condition_list> ;)? # <comment>
#
# <code>, <lower>, <title>, and <upper> provide character values in hex. If there is more than
# one character, they are separated by spaces. Other than as used to separate elements,
# spaces are to be ignored.
#
# The <condition_list> is optional. Where present, it consists of one or more locales or contexts,
# separated by spaces. In these conditions:
# - A condition list overrides the normal behavior if all of the listed conditions are true.
# - The context is always the context of the characters in the original string,
#   NOT in the resulting string.
# - Case distinctions in the condition list are not significant.
# - Conditions preceded by "Not_" represent the negation of the condition.
#
# A locale is defined as:
# <locale> := <ISO_639_code> ( "_" <ISO_3166_code> ( "_" <variant> )? )?
# <ISO_3166_code> := 2-letter ISO country code,
# <ISO_639_code> :=  2-letter ISO language code
#
# A context is one of the following, as defined in the Unicode Standard:
#   Final_Sigma, After_Soft_Dotted, More_Above, Before_Dot, Not_Before_Dot, After_I
#
# Parsers of this file must be prepared to deal with future additions to this format:
#  * Additional contexts
#  * Additional fields
