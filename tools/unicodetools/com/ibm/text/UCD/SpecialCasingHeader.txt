# Special Casing Properties

# This file is a supplement to the UnicodeData file.
# It contains additional information about the casing of Unicode characters.
# (For compatibility, the UnicodeData.txt file only contains case mappings for
# characters where they are 1-1, and does not have locale-specific mappings.)
# For more information, see
# UTR #21 Case Mappings, at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/

# Format
# ================================================================================
# The entries in this file are in the following machine-readable format:
#
# <code>; <lower> ; <title> ; <upper> ; (<condition_list> ;)? # <comment>
#
# <code>, <lower>, <title>, and <upper> provide character values in hex. If there is more than
# one character, they are separated by spaces.
#
# The <condition_list> is optional. Where present, it consists of one or more locales or contexts,
# separated by spaces. In these conditions:
# - A condition list overrides the normal behavior if all of the listed conditions are true.
# - Case distinctions in the condition list are not significant.
# - Conditions preceded by "NOT_" represent the negation of the condition.
# - A cased letter is any character with general category = Ll or Lo or Lt
# - An ignorable sequence is a sequence of *zero* or more characters from
#    the set {HYPHEN, SOFT HYPHEN, general category = Mn}.
#
# A locale is defined as:
# <locale> := <ISO_639_code> ( "_" <ISO_3166_code> ( "_" <variant> )? )?
# <ISO_3166_code> := 2-letter ISO country code,
# <ISO_639_code> :=  2-letter ISO language code
#
# A context is a locale or one of the following choices:
#   CFINAL:      The character is not followed by a sequence consisting of
#                an ignorable sequence and then a cased letter.
#   CINITIAL:    The character is not preceded by a sequence consisting of
#                a cased letter and an ignorable sequence.
#   FINAL_SIGMA: CFINAL and NOT_CINITIAL
#   TYPE_i:      The character is "i" (0069), "j" (006A),
#                or has a canonical decomposition that begins with an "i" or "j"
#                but has no combining characters above (i.e., i-ogonek (012F),
#                i-tilde-below (1E2D), or i-dot-below (1ECB)).
#   AFTER_i:     The last preceding base character was TYPE_i, and
#                no combining character class 230 (above) has intervened.
#   MORE_ABOVE:  The character is followed by one or more characters of
#                combining class 230 (ABOVE) in the combining character sequence
#
# Other than as used to separate elements, spaces are to be ignored.
#
# Parsers of this file must be prepared to deal future additions to this format:
#  * Additional contexts
#  * Additional fields
