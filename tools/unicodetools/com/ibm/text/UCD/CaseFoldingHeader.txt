# Case Folding Properties
#
# This file is a supplement to the UnicodeData file.
# It provides a case folding mapping generated from the Unicode Character Database.
# If all characters are mapped according to the full mapping below, then
# case differences (according to UnicodeData.txt and SpecialCasing.txt)
# are eliminated.
#
# The data supports both implementations that require simple case foldings
# (where string lengths don't change), and implementations that allow full case folding
# (where string lengths may grow). Note that where they can be supported, the
# full case foldings are superior: for example, they allow "MASSE" and "Maﬂe" to match.
#
# NOTE: case folding does not preserve normalization formats!
#
# For information on case folding, see
# UTR #21 Case Mappings, at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/

# Format
# ================================================================================
# The entries in this file are in the following machine-readable format:
#
# <code>; <status>; <mapping>; # <name>
#
# The status field is:
# C: common case folding, common mappings shared by both simple and full mappings.
# F: full case folding, mappings that cause strings to grow in length. Multiple characters are separated by spaces.
# S: simple case folding, mappings to single characters where different from F.
# I: special case for dotted uppercase I and dotless lowercase i
#    - If this mapping is included, the result is case-insensitive, but dotless and dotted I's are not distinguished.
#    - If this mapping is excluded, the result is not fully case-insensitive, but dotless and dotted I's are distinguished.
#
# Usage:
#  A. To do a simple case folding, use the mappings with status C + S + I.
#  B. To do a full case folding, use the mappings with status C + F + I.
#    The mappings with status I can be omitted depending on the desired case-folding
#    behavior. (The default option is to retain them.)
